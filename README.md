## Pendency System

### Machine Coding interview

- Pendency is a system that is able to track counts of in-flight/in-progress entities.  
- The system is told when to start tracking a particular entity, and when to stop. And at any point the system can be asked how many entities are in-progress (or in-flight). The system is expected to give this count, as fast as possible  

- [Pendency System - Complete Problem Statement](https://github.com/alpha74/PendencySystem_JavaSpringBoot/blob/main/docs/problem_statement.md)


```
This is not the Code in actual interview.
Done as a practice for this problem statement.
Hence, design is done more thoughtfully.
